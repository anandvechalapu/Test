Spring Boot Application
The Spring Boot application will include a controller, service, and repository classes to implement the user story and associated acceptance criteria. The controller class will manage the user's interactions with the application, the service class will contain the code for code generation, and the repository class will handle the integration of the generated code with the Jira and GitHub APIs. The controller class will also contain the acceptance tests to verify the user's selections. The application will be built using Java and Spring Boot and the code will be published to GitHub for version control.
