Solution:
To fulfill this user story, we need to create a Spring Boot application with controller, service, and repository classes.

Controller Class: The controller class will be responsible for handling the HTTP requests and mapping them to the appropriate methods. It will also be responsible for getting the list of user stories from the service class and passing them to the front-end application.

Service Class: The service class will be responsible for fetching the user stories from the Jira API and storing them in the repository. It will also be responsible for providing the list of user stories to the controller class.

Repository Class: The repository class will be responsible for storing the fetched user stories from the Jira API. It will also be responsible for providing the list of user stories to the service class.
